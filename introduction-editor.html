<h1>Using Gregorio in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop</h1>

<p>This page describes how Gregorio is used with a <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> editor such as <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works or <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop or VSCode. If you are used to <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> compilation and know the command line tools, you can  refer to the <a href="./introduction-commandline.html">command line introduction</a>.</p>


<p>The editor must be correctly configured according to the instructions for <a href="./configuration-texworks.html"><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works</a> or <a href="./configuration-texshop.html"><span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop</a> or <a href="./configuration-vscode.html" >VSCode</a>. These instructions can be easily adapted for other tools using <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop markup, such as the <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools"><span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> Tools for SublimeText</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, producing a score involves these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>writing a gabc text file that describes the score</li>
<li>writing a <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> text file that describes the document which contains the score</li>
<li>running <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> to compile the document file and the gabc file</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gabc">Creating a gabc score file</h3>

<p>For a first example, you can take inspiration from the file <code>PopulusSion.gabc</code> in the <code>examples/</code> directory of the Gregorio software distribution (also <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/blob/master/examples/PopulusSion.gabc">here</a>).</p>

<p>See the <a href="./gabc/index.html">gabc page</a> for details about the gabc syntax. For now, let’s suppose you keep this score as it is and that you save it as <code>example.gabc</code>.<p>

<p>Save your gabc file in a new directory, which will be our working directory. You need to save it with the extension “<code>.gabc</code>”, and save it in UTF-8 encoding: under <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop, save it in “UTF8 Plain Text” format. </p>

<h3>Making a document and including your score</h3>

<p>This step will let you create a small document and include your score in it. It will be very basic, but from this basis, you’ll be able to do virtually anything you need, such as a booklet including more scores or a book.</p>

<p>To accomplish that, you will certainly need some understanding of <span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>, but for a first try, you can use the following barebones file:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>\documentclass[11pt]{article}<br />
<br />
\usepackage{fontspec}<br />
<br />
\usepackage[autocompile]{gregoriotex}<br />
<br />
\begin{document}<br />
<br />
\gregorioscore{example}<br />
<br />
\end{document}</code>
</div>

<p>Copy the above into a new file and save it as <code>test.tex</code> in the same directory as <code>example.gabc</code></p>

<h3 id="compile">Compiling the document</h3>
<p>The goal now is to compile this file using your <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> editor to produce a PDF output.  Select <code>LuaLaTeX+se</code> from the drop down list in the upper left, or automate this selection by placing the following line at the begining of the file:</p> 

<div class="commandline">
<code>% !TEX program = LuaLaTeX+se</code>
</div>

<p>Then click on the “Typeset” button.</p>

<p>If you correctly followed the instructions of this page, a PDF file will show up in the right side of your screen!  You’re now ready to start playing with your document file by using <a href="gregoriotex/details.html">the various Gregorio<span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> commands available to tweak the appearence of the score.</a></p>

<h3>Behind the scenes</h3>

<p>What you just did might seem a bit magical and confusing. Here is what really happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your editor launches the command <br/><code>lualatex --shell-escape test.tex</code></li>
  <li>Lua<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> compiles the document.  When it sees <code>\gregorioscore{example}</code>, it launches the command <br/><code>gregorio example.gabc</code></li>
  <li>Gregorio compiles your gabc score into <code>example-###.gtex</code> (where <code>###</code> is the version number of Gregorio).  You can check your folder for this file.</li>
  <li>Lua<span class="latex">L<span class="alpha">a</span>T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span> reads in the contents of <code>example-###.gtex</code> and continues the compilation of your document.
</ul>

<p>There is a mechanism to avoid repeated compilation if the gabc file and the Gregorio version have not changed.</p>

<h3 id="automation">Compiling directly from the score window</h3>

<p>It can be practical, when writing a gabc score, to compile directly from the window containing the gabc file. To allow that, add the following lines at the top of your gabc file:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>% !TEX root = test.tex</code><br />
<code>% !TEX TS-program = LuaLaTeX+se</code>
</div>

<p>The first line tells <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop that this file is part of a larger project whose main (or root) file is <code>test.tex</code>.  Now whenever you go to typeset <code>example.gabc</code> <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop wil typeset <code>test.tex</code> instead.  The second line is the same as in your tex file (it is mandatory under <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>works, optional in <span class="tex">T<span class="epsilon">e</span>X</span>Shop).</p>
