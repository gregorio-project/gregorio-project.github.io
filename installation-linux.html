<h1>Installing Gregorio under Linux</h1>

<p>This page describes the installation and compilation of Gregorio software under a GNU/Linux system.  Whether you install a precompiled version or whether you compile from source, it's a quick and easy operation.</p>

<h2>Getting the sources</h2>

<p>To obtain the sources of the stable version, you just need to download them from the <a href="https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio/releases">download page</a>, and decompress the archive.</p>

<p><b>Nota bene:</b> There are two different source code files on the download page: gregorio-x.x.x.tar.bz2 (where x.x.x is the version number) and "Source Code" (in both zip and tar.gz format).  "gregorio-x.x.x.tar.bz2" is a special distribution version of the source which has several files, which do not depend on your particular system's architecture, pre-built for you.  As a result, it requires fewer tools to build, and should be the default choice for most people.  The file named "Source Code" is an image of the repository at the time of the release which is added automatically by GitHub.  As a result, the process for building from this file is identical to the process for building from a clone of the repository itself.</p>

<p>To get the development version, create
a local copy of the repository of the project, with the command:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/gregorio-project/gregorio.git gregorio-git</code><br/>
<code>cd gregorio-git</code>
</div>

<h2>Install dependencies</h2>

<p class="nofirst">Under Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>sudo aptitude install autotools-dev flex bison libltdl7-dev texlive-luatex autopoint python-fontforge</code>
</div>

For gregorio versions prior to 4.0, if you are using <span style="font-family: monospace;">--enable-xml-read</span> then this additional dependency is needed:

<div class="commandline">
  <code>libxml2-dev</code>
</div>

If you're using another distribution, some packages may have a slightly different name.

<h2>Building</h2>

<p class="nofirst">In the directory of the sources, run:</p>

<div class="commandline">
<code>$ ./build.sh</code><br/>
<code>$ sudo ./install.sh</code>
</div>

<h2>Updating</h2>

<p>To update your git version, you just need to go into the directory containing the source files (assuming you kept them), run <code>git pull</code> and recompile with the same commands.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>If you use TeXworks, it can be very helpful to <a href="./configuration-texworks.html">configure it for Gregorio</a>. Otherwise, you can refer to the <a href="./introduction-commandline.html">command line page</a>.</p>
